## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to our **end-to-end data mining adventure!**  
In this project, we dive deep into the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, exploring how real customers shop, how sellers perform, and what drives customer satisfaction in Brazil’s growing online marketplace.  

Our mission is to transform messy, real-world data into **actionable insights** — moving through every stage of the pipeline:  
**ETL → EDA → Data Mining → Insights & Storytelling.**

We aim to answer *real business questions*, build machine learning models, and visualize insights that help e-commerce platforms like Olist **make smarter, data-driven decisions.** 💡
