### *Uncovering Hidden Patterns in Brazil’s E-Commerce World* 🇧🇷  

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to our **end-to-end data mining adventure!**  
In this project, we dive deep into the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, exploring how real customers shop, how sellers perform, and what drives customer satisfaction in Brazil’s growing online marketplace.  

Our mission is to transform messy, real-world data into **actionable insights** — moving through every stage of the pipeline:  
**ETL → EDA → Data Mining → Insights & Storytelling.**

We aim to answer *real business questions*, build machine learning models, and visualize insights that help e-commerce platforms like Olist **make smarter, data-driven decisions.** 💡

## 🎯 Objectives & Research Questions

Our analysis focuses on solving key business problems through data-driven insights:

### 👩‍💻 Customer Insights
- Who are Olist’s most valuable customers?  
- Which **regions** in Brazil drive the most sales and revenue?  
- Can we segment customers based on purchase frequency or spending?

### 📦 Product & Sales Analysis
- Which **product categories** are top performers?  
- How does **seasonality** affect order volume?  
- What are the most preferred **payment methods** and how do they affect purchase value?

### ⭐ Customer Experience
- What factors influence **review scores**?  
- Do **late deliveries** lower satisfaction levels?  
- Are there **correlations** between order value, payment type, and ratings?

### 🧠 Predictive & Pattern Discovery
- Can we **predict** customer satisfaction levels?  
- Which products are **frequently bought together** (Market Basket Analysis)?
