## **Project Proposal: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis**

### **Course:** DSA 2040A – Data Mining

### **Dataset:** [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

---

### **Overview**

This project builds an end-to-end **data mining pipeline** using the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that explain customer behavior, purchasing trends, and product relationships in an online retail environment.

---

### **Objectives**

* Implement a complete pipeline: **ETL → Analysis → Mining → Insights**.
* Identify key customer segments and behavioral patterns.
* Discover product associations and repeat purchase predictors.
* Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard and executive summary.

---

### **Research Questions**

1. What customer segments generate the most revenue and activity?
2. Which products are frequently purchased together?
3. What factors influence repeat purchases or loyalty?

---

### **Methodology**

1. **ETL & Preparation** – Clean, merge, and enrich multi-table data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – Visualize distributions, correlations, and key trends.
3. **Data Mining** – Apply clustering (K-means), association rules (Apriori), and classification (Decision Tree).
4. **Insights & Storytelling** – Present key findings via dashboard and summary report.

### **Tools & Technologies**

Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · MLxtend · Seaborn · Matplotlib · Plotly · Power BI · GitHub

---

### **Expected Outcomes**

* Clear segmentation of customer types and their purchase behavior.
* Product bundle recommendations from association rule mining.
* Predictive indicators for customer retention.
* Dashboard summarizing 3–5 data-driven insights.

---

### **Significance**

This project demonstrates how data mining converts large-scale e-commerce data into strategic intelligence. Though based on a Brazilian dataset, the methods and insights are highly transferable to Kenya’s growing digital commerce sector.
